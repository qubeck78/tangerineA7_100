2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk100_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk100_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_1_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

There is a large setup violation of -7.567 ns between tangerineA7_100_i/tangerineSOC_0/U0/vgaInst/pgCursorY_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk100_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_1_0) and tangerineA7_100_i/tangerineSOC_0/U0/vgaInst/pixelGenInst/pgLutBackgroundColor_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
