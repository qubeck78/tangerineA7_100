2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk162_5_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_2_0 and clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk162_5_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_2_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#3 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk64_tangerineA7_100_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_pll_i are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) sdMciDat[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sdMciDat[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) tangerineA7_100_i/sdMciDat[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sdMciDat_IBUF[0]) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#2 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) tangerineA7_100_i/tangerineSOC_0/sdMciDat[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (tangerineA7_100_i/tangerineSOC_0/sdMciDat[0]) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '60' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
